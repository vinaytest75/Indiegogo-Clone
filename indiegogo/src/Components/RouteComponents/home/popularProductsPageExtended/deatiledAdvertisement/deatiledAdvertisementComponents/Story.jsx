                                    Surveys show that we may spend an average of 19 hours sitting or lying down. Thatâ€™s 19 of the 24 hours in a 
                                    day! Prolonged sitting is extremely unhealthy, having an adverse effect on our circulatory system, 
                                    blood vessels, and nervous system. Unfortunately, most of us spend the majority of our time awake sitting; 
                                    we sit at work, in the car, and at home in front of a TV or computer screen. Essentially, we go from sitting 
                                    in one place to sitting in another.

                                <p className = {Styles.writeUpPart} > According to a report by the World Health Organization, the harm of a sedentary lifestyle is second 
                                    only to smoking. Working, driving, and doing homework will require sitting throughout the day. 
                                    Sitting for a long time not only hurts the spine but also can leave you easily getting dizzy. 
                                    With Edeskhub, we recommend a 
                                    <span className = {Styles.spanData} > one-hour working method: sit for 45min, then stand for 15min. </span>  
                                    Using this alternating routine can not only reduce spinal pressure but also improve 
                                    work efficiency.
